                    As a TAW member, you are not allowed to, as a member of another gaming organization, play a game that TAW offers. We expect that you will play that game with TAW and support our team!

                   <br><br>We encourage members to wear their TAW tags with pride outside the games TAW plays, but this is not a requirement. Wearing tags or not, remember that you represent TAW at all times. We understand loyalty is earned, and TAW will work hard to earn yours, but we will not hesitate to remove members that violate these rules.
